# ∞ Infinite Website ∞

This is a website that I made for fun. It's a website that has infinites pages. It's made with Next.js and OpenAI's GPT-3 API. It generates pages on the fly given a url. It's a bit slow, but it works. 

## Getting Started

First, setup your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file. It should look like this:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Then install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
